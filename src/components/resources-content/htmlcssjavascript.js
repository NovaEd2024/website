        <h2>Get familiar with HTML and CSS</h2>
        <p>Path 1 is a thorough, slower-paced, approach that we highly recommend for those completely new to HTML and CSS, with no prior web development experience. While it may be a bit lengthy, sections 1, 2, 8, 9, 11, and 12 are the most vital components. However, if you have some familiarity with HTML and CSS, we suggest Path 2 - a faster-paced journey that provides a rapid understanding of these technologies while actively working on a project. We strongly urge you to code along!</p>

        <h2>CSS FlexBox vs. Grid</h2>
        <p>Flexbox and grid are both powerful layout mechanisms in CSS, but they have different strengths. Flexbox is ideal for laying out items in a single row or column, while grid is best suited for laying out items in a two-dimensional grid. They will be used fairly often when building your website.</p>

        <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
        <p>Responsive web design in CSS is an approach that allows websites to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. It's important because it ensures that websites look great and function properly on any device, which is crucial for providing a positive user experience and improving engagement and conversion rates.</p>

        <h2>JavaScript:</h2>
        <p>We assume that you already possess a fundamental understanding of coding, we will not be covering the syntax of JavaScript. You can learn this as you engage in your projects, and if you feel the need for some guidance, we encourage you to search for relevant tutorials. However, a crucial aspect of JavaScript development is grasping the concept of asynchronous code. To aid in this, we suggest following the tutorials below to gain a better understanding.</p>
