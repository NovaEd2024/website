            <p>Git is a version-control system that you will use to update your team's code. This tutorial will cover most of the necessary functions. If you need a different function or a more thorough explanation, you will find it online.</p>
            <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Terminal proficiency</li>
                <li>Git installed</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Windows: <a href="https://gitforwindows.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://gitforwindows.org/</a></li>

                </ul>
            </ul>
            <p>To make sure you have git installed, run the following command in your terminal. It should return a version number if that's true.</p>
            <pre><code>git --version</code></pre>
            <h2>Basic Git Functions</h2>
            <p>First, create a folder ‚Äútest‚Äù. Mine will be located in the Downloads folder, but you can put it wherever. We will use it for testing purposes.</p>
            <p>Open your terminal and change your current directory to be inside the ‚Äútest‚Äù folder.</p>
            <img src={git1} alt="" />
            <p>Run the following command to initialize the git repository</p>

            <h1>Intro to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</h1>
            <p>Gain a swift understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As you progress through this tutorial, there's no need to commit everything to memory; our aim is to simply acquaint you with the appearance of the code. Remember, when constructing your web applications, it's perfectly acceptable to rely on online resources.</p>

            <h2>Get familiar with HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p>Path 1 is a thorough, slower-paced, approach that we highly recommend for those completely new to HTML and CSS, with no prior web development experience. While it may be a bit lengthy, sections 1, 2, 8, 9, 11, and 12 are the most vital components. However, if you have some familiarity with HTML and CSS, we suggest Path 2 - a faster-paced journey that provides a rapid understanding of these technologies while actively working on a project. We strongly urge you to code along!</p>

            <h2>CSS FlexBox vs. Grid</h2>
            <p>Flexbox and grid are both powerful layout mechanisms in CSS, but they have different strengths. Flexbox is ideal for laying out items in a single row or column, while grid is best suited for laying out items in a two-dimensional grid. They will be used fairly often when building your website.</p>

            <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
            <p>Responsive web design in CSS is an approach that allows websites to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. It's important because it ensures that websites look great and function properly on any device, which is crucial for providing a positive user experience and improving engagement and conversion rates.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>why?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>moodboard is a great way to plan out the ~vibes~ of your website/design. It's an easy way to get inspiration and figure out how and what you want in your designs.</li>
                    <li>the algorithm for Pinterest goes CRAZY HARD if you see an image that you like, it will give you similar images with the same vibes/theme so it makes the mood-boarding process a lot easier!</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>go to Pinterest <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a></li>
                <li>search for whatever you want (website designs, home page design, search bar design, whatever)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>if you see something you like, hover on the image, and a ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button should appear. Save it and create a mood board with whatever name you desire</li>
                    <li>should be intuitive but if not, here's a quick video of how! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUuihZp8udY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a></li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h2>üÖ∞Ô∏è Fonts and Colors </h2>
            <p>Making memorable designs is intentional with the fonts and colors you choose.</p>
            <p>FUN FACT O'CLOCK!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The color red: Ever notice how almost all fast food places have the color red? (think mcd, panda express, in-n-out, literally everything) this is being when your brain sees red, it produces a sense of hunger!</li>
                <li>The color blue: All the big tech companies, their main color is blue! Blue is seen as dependable and reliable (think meta, Twitter, LinkedIn, Zoom) All your favorite products are very intentional with the colors they choose.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>IMPORTANT: the most important when it comes to design is if YOU think it looks good! be confident in your choices üòé</p>
            <h3>WHERE DO I FIND FONTS? (for free)</h3>
            <p>Every Berkeley students have free access to everything Adobe related</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Adobe Fonts</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.dafont.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Da Font</a></li>
            </ul>
            <p>These are my favorite two websites to get fonts from, but you can literally search for ‚ÄúFree fonts‚Äù and a lot will show up. A good way to find inspiration is through your mood board or your favorite websites!</p>
            <h3>WHERE DO I FIND COLORS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Look through your mood board and see what main colors you choose. Think about how those colors make you feel. Does it address the feel of the product you are creating?</li>
                <li>A good rule of thumb for colors: üëç</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>you usually will have 1-2 main colors</li>
                    <li>1-3 accent colors (supporting colors)</li>
                    <li>don't want to have more than 3-4 colors because then it gets overwhelming and takes away the attention of the product you are building!</li>
                </ul>
                <li><a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://coolors.co/</a></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>good for a color generation if you need to vibe it out!</li>

            <p>Think Adobe Illustrator, but a lot more approachable and made for website building, wireframing, and prototyping. A lot easier to use and super easy to learn (learning curve is literally a flat line, trust)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>you can sign up with Figma using your berkeley.edu email (free!) you can either use it on a browser or download it down to your laptop</li>
