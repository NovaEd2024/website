        <h2>‚úèÔ∏è Moodboard Building with Pinterest</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>why?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>moodboard is a great way to plan out the ~vibes~ of your website/design. It's an easy way to get inspiration and figure out how and what you want in your designs.</li>
                <li>the algorithm for Pinterest goes CRAZY HARD if you see an image that you like, it will give you similar images with the same vibes/theme so it makes the mood-boarding process a lot easier!</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>go to Pinterest <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a></li>
            <li>search for whatever you want (website designs, home page design, search bar design, whatever)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>if you see something you like, hover on the image, and a ‚ÄúSave‚Äù button should appear. Save it and create a mood board with whatever name you desire</li>
                <li>should be intuitive but if not, here's a quick video of how! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUuihZp8udY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a></li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <h2>üÖ∞Ô∏è Fonts and Colors </h2>
        <p>Making memorable designs is intentional with the fonts and colors you choose.</p>
        <p>FUN FACT O'CLOCK!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The color red: Ever notice how almost all fast food places have the color red? (think mcd, panda express, in-n-out, literally everything) this is being when your brain sees red, it produces a sense of hunger!</li>
            <li>The color blue: All the big tech companies, their main color is blue! Blue is seen as dependable and reliable (think meta, Twitter, LinkedIn, Zoom) All your favorite products are very intentional with the colors they choose.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>IMPORTANT: the most important when it comes to design is if YOU think it looks good! be confident in your choices üòé</p>
        <h3>WHERE DO I FIND FONTS? (for free)</h3>
        <p>Every Berkeley students have free access to everything Adobe related</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Adobe Fonts</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.dafont.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Da Font</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are my favorite two websites to get fonts from, but you can literally search for ‚ÄúFree fonts‚Äù and a lot will show up. A good way to find inspiration is through your mood board or your favorite websites!</p>
        <h3>WHERE DO I FIND COLORS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Look through your mood board and see what main colors you choose. Think about how those colors make you feel. Does it address the feel of the product you are creating?</li>
            <li>A good rule of thumb for colors: üëç</li>
            <ul>
                <li>you usually will have 1-2 main colors</li>
                <li>1-3 accent colors (supporting colors)</li>
                <li>don't want to have more than 3-4 colors because then it gets overwhelming and takes away the attention of the product you are building!</li>
            </ul>
            <li><a href="https://coolors.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://coolors.co/</a></li>
            <ul>
                <li>good for a color generation if you need to vibe it out!</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>WHAT IS FIGMA? <a href="https://figma.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a></h3>
